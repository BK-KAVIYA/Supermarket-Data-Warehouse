# Supermarket Data Warehouse

This repository contains the design and implementation of a data warehouse tailored for a supermarket environment. The warehouse serves as a centralized repository to manage and analyze various operational aspects of the supermarket's ecosystem.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this data warehouse is to provide a consolidated and unified view of the supermarket's operations. It integrates data from multiple sources to facilitate analysis, reporting, and decision-making across different departments.

## Architecture
- **ETL Integration:** Utilizes Talend and Informatica as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tools to efficiently gather, transform, and load data from diverse sources.
- **Dimensional Modeling:** Implements logical and physical schema designs optimized for specific Database Management Systems (DBMSs) to enhance query performance and analytical capabilities.

## Components
### Fact Tables
